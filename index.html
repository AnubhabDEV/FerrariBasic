        Ferrari S.p.A.  is an Italian luxury 
        sports car manufacturer based in Maranello, Italy. Founded by Enzo 
        Ferrari in 1939 out of the Alfa Romeo race division as Auto Avio Costruzioni, 
        the company built its first car in 1940, and produced its first 
        Ferrari-badged car in 1947.

        Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued 
        participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where it is the 
        oldest and most successful racing team, holding the most constructors 
        championships (16) and having produced the highest number of drivers' 
        championship wins (15). Ferrari road cars are generally seen as a symbol 
        of speed, luxury and wealth. Ferrari cars are built at the 165,000 
        square-meter (16.5-hectare) Maranello factory. In 2014 Ferrari was 
        rated the world's most powerful brand by Brand Finance. 
        In June 2018, a 1963 250 GTO became the most expensive car 
        in history, setting an all-time record selling price of $70 million. 
        As of 2021, Ferrari is the 10th-largest car manufacturer by market 
        capitalisation, with $52.21 billion.
